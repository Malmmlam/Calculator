Plan   
    Restate
        build a working web calculator
            create a function that adds any number of given numbers together and returns the sum.
            create a function that subtracts any number of given numbers from each other and returns the difference.
            create a function that multiplies any given numbers and returns the product.
            create a function that divides any given numbers and returns the quotient. 
            create an operate function that takes two number and an operator and calls one of your other functions, with the two numbers as arguments, depending on the operator chosen. 


    Divide
        DONE
        create a function that accpets an array of numbers and adds them together. 
            use array.reduce function. 
        DONE
        create a function that accepts an array of numbers and subtracts them. 
            use array.reduce function
        DONE
        create a function that accpets an array of numbers and multiplies them. 
            use array.reduce function 
        DONE
        create a function that accepts an array of numbers and divides them
            array.reduce.
        DONE
        Create and operate function that takes an operator and two numbers. 
            switch case or ternarery
            is the operator a string?
            if the operator is + call the addition function
            if the operator is - call the subtraction function
            if the operator is * call the multiplication function
            if the operator is / call the divide function
        DONE
        Create a function that reads the user entered number and returns it back when the equals button is pressed. 
        DONE
        Write a calculate function that works with two numbers and any single operator.
        DONE
        Write a calculate function that works with more than two numbers and any single operator.
        Update calculate function to work with multiple operators following order of operations.

        REFACTOR
            Create a function that takes 2 single digit numbers entered by the user and passes them to the add function. 
                When the user clicks a number key the value of that number key is added to a variable. 
                The user then cliks a second number key. That keys value is added to the second variable and the answer is provided on the screen.
